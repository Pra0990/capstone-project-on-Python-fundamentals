# capstone-project-on-Python-fundamentals

I have developed a strong foundation in Python for data analytics, focusing on core programming concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, functions, and error handling. Building on this, Iâ€™ve applied key data manipulation techniques using lists, dictionaries, and loops to structure and analyze datasets effectively. My projects emphasize practical problem-solving using fundamental logic, with a gradual progression into real-world data cleaning, transformation, and basic statistical analysis. This journey reflects a solid understanding of how Python serves as a powerful tool in the early stages of data analytics and has laid the groundwork for more advanced applications in data science.
